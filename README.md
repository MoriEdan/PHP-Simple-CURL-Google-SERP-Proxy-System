PHP-Simple-CURL-Google-SERP-Proxy-System
========================================

To use this your host is required to allow remote proxy CURL requests. A Proxy list file is generated and saved based on return header status value.

Simple class for sending and retrieving search queries from Google. I plan to add output filtering at some point.
